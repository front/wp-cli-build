![WP-CLI Build](https://wputvikling.no/wp-cli-build.png)

**WP-CLI Build** helps you to start your WP site in an organized way and simplifies maintenance: you don't need to version code that you don't maintain yourself like WP core, themes or 3rd party plugins. This makes it easy to have [auto updates](https://github.com/front/wp-cli-build/wiki/Auto-update-your-website), without messing up your Git setup. **WP-CLI Build** is also useful for [rebuilding your site after a hack](https://github.com/front/wp-cli-build/wiki/Rebuild-from-an-attack). 
```sh
$ wp build
```

## Getting Started
### Prerequistes
This package requires [WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/) v1.5 or greater. You can check WP-CLI version with `$ wp --version` and update to the latest stable release with `$ wp cli update`. 

### Installing
**PHP 7.4:** Install **WP-CLI Build** from our git repo
```sh
$ wp package install front/wp-cli-build
```
**PHP 8.0:** Install **WP-CLI Build** from our git repo
```sh
$ wp package install front/wp-cli-build:8.0.0
```
**PHP 8.1:** Install **WP-CLI Build** from our git repo
```sh
$ wp package install front/wp-cli-build:8.1.0
```

**Note:** The WP-CLI package installer will fail silently if your memory limit is too low. To see if installation was successful, run `$ wp package list`. If empty, locate your php.ini and increase the memory_limit.

## Quick Start
You need WP installed to get started, so if you don't already have an existing site: `wp core download and install`.

The ***build*** file is the base of **WP-CLI Build** and will contain your WP site core configuration and the list of used public plugins and themes. Last version of **WP-CLI Build** will generate a *`build.json`* file but we still support *`build.yml`*, so you can use both. 

To generate the ***build*** file you should run:
```sh
$ wp build-generate
```
It will also rewrite your ***.gitignore*** to make sure only custom plugins and themes are indexed. Bellow, you can see a sample of the *WP-CLI BUILD BLOCK* added to ***.gitignore***:
```
# START WP-CLI BUILD BLOCK
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This block is auto generated every time you run 'wp build-generate'
# Rules: Exclude everything from Git except for your custom plugins and themes (that is: those that are not on wordpress.org)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
/*
!.gitignore
!build.json
!wp-content
wp-content/*
!wp-content/plugins
wp-content/plugins/*
!wp-content/themes
wp-content/themes/*
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Your custom themes/plugins
# Added automagically by WP-CLI Build (wp build-generate)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
!wp-content/plugins/custom-plugin-slug/
!wp-content/themes/custom-theme-slug/
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# END WP-CLI BUILD BLOCK
```

***Note:** Only active plugins and themes will be listed in **build** file and **gitignore**, unless you specify `--all` argument*.

For more options, see `$ wp build-generate --help`

## Using *build* file
You can run `$ wp build` to install the WordPress core of your site, 3rd party plugins and themes. It parses your ***build*** file, and works its magic!

A sample of a ***build.json*** file:

```
{
    "core": {
        "download": {
            "version": "~4.9.4",
            "locale": "en_US"
        }
    },
    "plugins": {
        "advanced-custom-fields": {
            "version": "*"
        },
        "timber-library": {
            "version": "^1.7.0"
        },
        "wordpress-seo": {
            "version": "*"
        }
    },
    "themes": {
        "twentyseventeen": {
            "version": "1.4"
        }
    }
}
```

A sample of a ***build.yml*** file:
```
core:
    download:
        version: "~4.9.4"
        locale: en_US
plugins:
    advanced-custom-fields
        version: "*"
    timber-library:
        version: "^1.7.0"
    wordpress-seo:
        version: "*"
themes:
    twentyseventeen:
        version: 1.4
```

Notice that you can use `~`, `*` and `^` operators when you don't want to refer a fixed version. 

### Updating *build* and *.gitignore*
When you add a new plugin to your WP site, you should run `$ wp build-generate` to update ***build*** and ***.gitignore*** files.

For more options run `$ wp --help build-generate` and `$ wp --help build`

### Clean install
Adding `--clean` option to `$ wp build` command forces all plugins to be deleted and downloaded again. It helps you make sure plugins are not corrupted.
